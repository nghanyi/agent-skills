# Jupiter Token Verification

Submit and pay for token verification on Jupiter via a simple REST API.

- **Base URL**: `https://token-verification-dev-api.jup.ag`
- **Auth**: API key required for submission endpoints (`x-api-key` header). Eligibility checks are unauthenticated.
- **Payment currency**: JUP (1 JUP per express verification)
- **Naming**: "Express" and "premium" refer to the same paid tier. The user-facing name is **express**, but the API uses `"premium"` as the `verificationTier` value.
- **Agent behavior**: Guide users step by step — collect parameters one at a time, validate each input, and confirm before submitting. See [Agent Conversation Flow](#agent-conversation-flow).

## Use / Do Not Use

**Use when:**

- Submitting a token for verification (basic or express)
- Paying for express verification with JUP tokens
- Checking the verification status of a token
- Updating token metadata (name, symbol, social links, etc.) alongside verification

**Do not use when:**

- Performing admin operations (verify, reject, unverify) — these require admin auth
- Swapping, lending, or trading — use `integrating-jupiter` skill instead

## Triggers

`verify token`, `token verification`, `submit verification`, `verification status`, `check verification`, `verification payment`, `pay for verification`, `express verification`, `basic verification`, `update token metadata`, `token metadata`, `update token info`

# Agent Conversation Flow

When a user triggers this skill, guide them through parameter collection step by step. Do NOT ask for all parameters at once — collect them incrementally, validate each input, and confirm before making API calls.

## Step-by-Step Parameter Collection

### 1. Determine Intent

Ask the user what they want to do:

> What would you like to do?
>
> 1. **Check** if a token is eligible for verification
> 2. **Submit** a token for verification
> 3. **Update metadata** for a token (e.g., name, symbol, social links)

If the user's message already makes their intent clear, skip this question.

For **"update metadata" intent**: proceed to Step 2 (tier selection) → Step 3 (collect mint) → Step 4 (check eligibility). The eligibility endpoint must match the tier selected in Step 2.

### 2. Choose Verification Tier

Before collecting the mint address, determine which tier the user wants. This ensures only one eligibility endpoint is called later.

**Auto-select from user intent:** If the user's original message already indicates which tier they want, use their choice directly:

- Phrases like `express verification`, `paid verification`, `express flow` → auto-select **express**
- Phrases like `basic verification`, `free verification` → auto-select **basic**

**Otherwise, ask:**

> Would you like **basic** (free) or **express** (1 JUP) verification?
>
> - **Basic** — free, standard review process
> - **Express** — costs 1 JUP, paid from your wallet

Default to `express` if the user is unsure, approvals are faster.

### 3. Collect Token Mint Address (always required)

Ask:

> What is the **Solana token mint address** you'd like to verify?

**Validate before proceeding:**

- Must be a valid base58 string
- Typically 32–44 characters
- If invalid, say: _"That doesn't look like a valid Solana mint address. It should be a base58 string like `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`. Please try again."_

### 4. Check Token Eligibility (single tier)

After collecting the mint, check eligibility for **only** the tier selected in Step 2 — do NOT call both endpoints:

- **Basic**: `GET /combined/basic/check-eligibility?tokenId={tokenId}`
- **Express**: `GET /combined/express/check-eligibility?tokenId={tokenId}`

Use the result to determine which flow to follow:

**A) Token is already verified** — endpoint returns `canVerify: false` and the `verificationError` message indicates an existing (non-rejected) verification:

> This token is **already verified** on Jupiter.

| `canMetadata` | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`        | Offer metadata update: _"Would you like to **update the token metadata** (name, symbol, social links, etc.)?"_ If yes → proceed to Step 5 (API key) → Step 6a (metadata collection) → Step 7 (confirm) → Step 8 (metadata-only). The tier selected in Step 2 still applies — **express** metadata-only updates go through the payment flow, **basic** metadata-only updates use `POST /basic/submit`. If no → done. |
| `false`       | Report: _"Metadata updates are also not available at this time."_ Done.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**B) Token can be verified** — endpoint returned `canVerify: true`:

Proceed to **Step 4a** (Check Metadata Availability), then continue to Step 5.

**C) Token cannot be verified** — `canVerify: false` with an error other than existing verification (e.g., token not found, not eligible for this tier):

Explain why the token is not eligible in plain language. If `canMetadata: true`, offer a metadata-only update. Otherwise stop.

**For "check-only" intent** (user just wants to know status): report whether the token is eligible for the selected tier, whether metadata updates are available, and any errors. Done — do not proceed to submission.

### 4a. Check Metadata Availability

After confirming the token can be verified, check the `canMetadata` result from the eligibility response retrieved in Step 4:

| `canMetadata` | Action                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`        | Ask: _"Would you also like to **update token metadata** (name, symbol, social links, etc.)?"_ If yes → metadata fields will be collected in Step 6a. If no → skip Step 6a. |
| `false`       | Inform: _"Metadata updates are not available for this token."_ Skip Step 6a.                                                                                               |

### 5. Resolve API Key

Before any authenticated call (`POST /basic/submit`, `GET /payments/express/craft-txn`, `POST /payments/express/execute`), resolve the API key:

1. Check `.env` / `.env.local` for `JUPITER_API_KEY` or `JUP_API_KEY`
2. If not found, guide the user through generating a new API key:
   - Direct them to open `https://vrfd-auth-api-dev.jup.ag/api/keys/new` in their browser — this handles login and key generation in one flow
   - **Important:** The key is shown **once** and cannot be retrieved again. Tell the user to copy it immediately.
   - Creating a new key automatically **revokes** any existing active key for their account
3. Once the user has their key, ask them to store it in `.env` as `JUPITER_API_KEY=<key>` and ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`

The key is passed via the `x-api-key` header. Rate limit: 2 requests/day per key.

For full API key management details (listing keys, revoking keys), see [API Reference — Managing Keys](references/api-reference.md#managing-keys).

### 6. Collect Remaining Parameters (one at a time)

Collect these in order. For each, show what it is and why it matters:

**a) Token's Twitter/X URL** (required for express, optional for basic)

> What is the **token project's Twitter/X URL**?
> Example: `https://x.com/jupiterexchange`

For **basic** tier, the user may skip this — if skipped, omit the field entirely from the request (do not send an empty string).

Validate: must be a full URL starting with `https://x.com/` or `https://twitter.com/` followed by a valid username (1–15 chars, alphanumeric + underscore). If the user provides a bare handle like `@handle`, auto-convert it to `https://x.com/handle` and confirm with the user.

**b) Requester's Twitter/X URL** (optional)

> What is **your** Twitter/X URL? This identifies who submitted the request.
> Example: `https://x.com/your_handle` > _(Type "skip" to leave blank)_

Same validation as above. **If skipped, omit this field entirely from the request — do not send an empty string.**

**c) Description** (required for express, optional for basic)

> Please provide a **short description** of the token.
> Example: _"Community governance token for XYZ protocol"_

For **basic** tier, the user may skip this — if skipped, omit the field entirely from the request (do not send an empty string).

**d) Wallet Address** (required for all flows)

A wallet address is needed for both `POST /basic/submit` and the express payment flow. Collect it once here so it's available regardless of tier.

Resolve the wallet address automatically before asking the user:

1. Check `.env` / `.env.local` for `PRIVATE_KEY` or `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`
2. Check for a Solana keypair file at `~/.config/solana/id.json`
3. If a private key is found, derive the wallet address using `Keypair.fromSecretKey` and confirm with the user: _"I found a private key in your environment and derived the wallet address `{address}`. Should I use this?"_
4. If no private key is found, ask directly:

> What is your **Solana wallet address**?

**Validation (user-provided addresses only):** Use `new PublicKey(address)` from `@solana/web3.js` to validate. If the constructor throws, the address is invalid — tell the user and ask again. Do not apply this validation when the address was derived from a private key (it is already guaranteed valid).

### 6a. Collect Metadata Fields (when metadata is included)

Runs when the user opted in at Step 4a **or** in a metadata-only flow (`canVerify: false, canMetadata: true`).

#### 6a-i. Fetch existing token data

Before collecting user input, fetch the current token data so existing values are preserved:

```http
GET {BASE_URL}/tokenMetadata/getFromRpcAndSearch/{tokenId}
```

This endpoint is unauthenticated. It returns:

```json
{
  "rpc": {
    "assetId": "...",
    "icon": "https://...",
    "name": "Current Name",
    "symbol": "CUR",
    "website": "https://...",
    "telegram": "...",
    "twitter": "...",
    "twitterCommunity": null,
    "discord": "...",
    "instagram": "...",
    "tiktok": "..."
  },
  "search": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Current Name",
      "symbol": "CUR",
      "icon": "https://...",
      "website": "https://...",
      "twitter": "...",
      "telegram": "..."
    }
  ],
  "description": {
    "description": "Current token description text"
  }
}
```

Use `search[0]` as the primary source for token info, `description.description` for `tokenDescription`, and `rpc` only for fields not available in `search` or when overriding on-chain metadata.

**Field mapping:**

| Source | Field |
| --- | --- |
| `search[0].id` | `tokenId` |
| `search[0].name` | `name` |
| `search[0].symbol` | `symbol` |
| `search[0].icon` | `icon` |
| `search[0].website` | `website` |
| `search[0].twitter` | `twitter` |
| `search[0].telegram` | `telegram` |
| `description.description` | `tokenDescription` |
| `rpc.twitterCommunity` | `twitterCommunity` (not in search) |
| `rpc.discord` | `discord` (not in search) |
| `rpc.instagram` | `instagram` (not in search) |
| `rpc.tiktok` | `tiktok` (not in search) |

#### 6a-ii. Collect user updates

Present the available fields:

> Here are the metadata fields you can update:
>
> **Identity:** name, symbol, icon, tokenDescription
> **Links:** website, twitter, twitterCommunity, telegram, discord, instagram, tiktok, otherUrl
> **Supply & Market Data:** circulatingSupply, circulatingSupplyUrl, coingeckoCoinId
>
> Which fields would you like to update?

Ask which fields they want to update, then collect new values **only** for those fields.

#### 6a-iii. Merge and build tokenMetadata

Start with the existing data fetched in 6a-i, then override with the user's updates from 6a-ii. Send **all** fields in the `tokenMetadata` object so that unchanged fields retain their current values.

**Field collection rules:**

- `tokenId` is auto-filled from the token mint collected in Step 3 — do not ask for it
- When the user provides a value for `circulatingSupply`, auto-set `useCirculatingSupply: true`
- When the user provides a value for `coingeckoCoinId`, auto-set `useCoingeckoCoinId: true`
- When the user provides a value for `circulatingSupplyUrl`, auto-set `useCirculatingSupplyUrl: true`
- URL fields (website, twitter, discord, etc.) should be validated as proper URLs
- See [API Reference — tokenMetadata Object](references/api-reference.md#tokenmetadata-object) for the full schema

**Example:** If the existing data has `name: "Old Name"`, `symbol: "OLD"`, `icon: "https://icon.png"`, `tokenDescription: "A great token"` and the user only wants to update `name` and `symbol`, the final `tokenMetadata` object must include all fields:

```json
{
  "tokenId": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
  "name": "New Name",
  "symbol": "NEW",
  "icon": "https://icon.png",
  "tokenDescription": "A great token"
}
```

This ensures `icon` and `tokenDescription` are preserved. If you only sent `name` and `symbol`, the other fields would be cleared.

For **metadata-only** flow (when `canVerify: false, canMetadata: true`): this step is the primary collection step — verification params from Step 6 are skipped.

### 7. Confirm Before Submitting

Present a summary of all collected parameters and ask for confirmation:

> Here's a summary of your verification request:
>
> | Field             | Value                       |
> | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
> | **Token Mint**    | `{tokenId}`                 |
> | **Tier**          | {basic/express}             |
> | **Token Twitter** | {url or _not provided_}     |
> | **Your Twitter**  | {url or _not provided_}     |
> | **Description**   | {text or _not provided_}    |
> | **Wallet**        | {address or _not provided_} |

If metadata fields were collected in Step 6a, add them to the summary:

> | **Metadata** | |
> | **— Name** | {value or _not provided_} |
> | **— Symbol** | {value or _not provided_} |
> | _(etc. for each collected field)_ | |

For **metadata-only** flow, adjust the heading: _"Here's a summary of your metadata update request:"_ and omit verification-only fields (tier, token twitter, your twitter, description).

> Does this look correct? (yes/no)

If the user says no, ask which field to change.

### 8. Submit and Report

**Important: When including `tokenMetadata`, always send all fields** — use existing data from `GET /tokenMetadata/getFromRpcAndSearch/{tokenId}` as the base, with the user's updates merged on top (see Step 6a). This ensures unchanged fields retain their current values.

- For **basic**: call `POST /basic/submit` with `submitVerification: true` and the collected parameters. Include `tokenMetadata` in the request body when metadata fields were collected in Step 6a — the `tokenMetadata` object should contain all fields (existing + user updates). Report the result — response includes `verificationCreated` and `metadataCreated` booleans. Done. (See [API Reference](references/api-reference.md) for request/response details.)
- For **express**: load [Payment Execution](references/payment-execution.md) and follow steps 7a–7e. The agent will resolve the user's private key, write a payment script, execute it locally, and report the result. When metadata fields were collected, they are included in the execute request body as `tokenMetadata` — include all fields (existing + user updates).
- For **metadata-only with basic tier** (when `canVerify: false, canMetadata: true` and basic was selected in Step 2): call `POST /basic/submit` with `submitVerification: false` and include `tokenMetadata` with all fields (existing + user updates). Do not include verification parameters. Report `metadataCreated` result.
- For **metadata-only with express tier** (when `canVerify: false, canMetadata: true` and express was selected in Step 2): load [Payment Execution](references/payment-execution.md) and follow steps 7a–7e. The payment flow still applies (1 JUP) — include `tokenMetadata` with all fields (existing + user updates). The execute endpoint will skip verification creation (since `canVerify: false`) but will create the metadata update. Report `metadataCreated` result.

# Input Auto-Correction

When collecting user input, handle these common mistakes gracefully instead of rejecting outright:

| User provides                           | Auto-correct to                 | Confirm with user?                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@jupiterexchange`                      | `https://x.com/jupiterexchange` | Yes — _"I'll format that as `https://x.com/jupiterexchange` — is that correct?"_ |
| `jupiterexchange` (bare handle)         | `https://x.com/jupiterexchange` | Yes                                                                              |
| `twitter.com/handle` (no https)         | `https://twitter.com/handle`    | Yes                                                                              |
| `x.com/handle` (no https)               | `https://x.com/handle`          | Yes                                                                              |
| Token mint with leading/trailing spaces | Trimmed string                  | No                                                                               |
