# Jupiter Token Verification

This skill covers the public token verification submission flow.

- **Base URL**: `https://token-verification-dev-api.jup.ag`
- **Cost**: 1 JUP
- **Public routes covered**:
  - `GET /express/check-eligibility`
  - `GET /payments/express/craft-txn`
  - `POST /payments/express/execute`
- **Auth**: no API key required for the public submission flow

## Use / Do Not Use

**Use when:**

- checking whether a token is eligible for submission
- crafting and signing the submission payment transaction
- executing the submission flow
- optionally updating token metadata as part of the submission

**Do not use when:**

- the agent would need private or internal routes
- the agent needs to fetch or merge existing metadata from non-public endpoints
- the user wants swaps, trading, or unrelated Jupiter flows

## Triggers

`verify token`, `submit verification`, `check eligibility`, `craft payment transaction`, `execute payment`, `pay for verification`

## Intent Router

| User intent | Endpoint | Method | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Check eligibility | `/express/check-eligibility?tokenId=...` | `GET` | None |
| Craft payment transaction | `/payments/express/craft-txn?senderAddress=...` | `GET` | None |
| Sign and execute payment | `/payments/express/execute` | `POST` | None |

## References

Load these on demand:

- **[API Reference](references/api-reference.md)** for request and response shapes for the 3 public routes
- **[Payment Execution](references/payment-execution.md)** when the user wants to submit and has confirmed the paying wallet details

## Execution Notes

For submission requests in constrained agent environments:

- outbound HTTP from `curl` or the local Node script may require sandbox approval or escalation
- package installation may require approval or escalation
- prefer an ESM temp workspace and `node --experimental-strip-types pay.ts` over `npx tsx pay.ts` in sandboxed Codex environments, because `tsx` may fail when it cannot open its IPC pipe

# Agent Conversation Flow

Extract as much as possible from the user's first message. Skip questions whose answers are already present.

## Step 0. Extract Upfront Parameters

Look for:

- intent: explicit eligibility-only check or submission help
- token mint
- paying wallet address
- token Twitter URL or handle
- requester Twitter URL or handle
- description
- confirmation that the paying wallet holds at least 1 JUP plus a small amount of SOL for fees

## Step 1. Route the Request

If the user explicitly asks only to check eligibility, do that and stop after the eligibility response.

Otherwise, proceed directly into the submission flow. If the user says `verify`, `submit`, `apply`, or similar, treat it as a submission request.

## Step 2. Collect Token Mint

`tokenId` is always required. Validate that it is a Solana public key.

## Step 3. Check Eligibility

Call:

```http
GET {BASE_URL}/express/check-eligibility?tokenId={tokenId}
```

Interpret the result:

- `canVerify: true` means the token can enter the submission flow
- `canVerify: false` means the user cannot submit; explain `verificationError`
- `canMetadata: true` means the execute endpoint can also accept a `tokenMetadata` update
- `canMetadata: false` means metadata cannot be updated in this submission

For an eligibility-only request, report the result and stop here.

## Step 3a. Offer Metadata Update

If `canMetadata: true`, ask the user whether they would also like to update their token metadata as part of this submission.

If they say **yes**, present the available metadata fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `icon` | string | Token icon URL |
| `name` | string | Token name |
| `symbol` | string | Token symbol |
| `website` | string | Project website URL |
| `telegram` | string | Telegram link |
| `twitter` | string | Twitter / X URL |
| `twitterCommunity` | string | Twitter community URL |
| `discord` | string | Discord invite link |
| `instagram` | string | Instagram URL |
| `tiktok` | string | TikTok URL |
| `circulatingSupply` | string | Circulating supply value |
| `useCirculatingSupply` | boolean | Enable circulating supply display |
| `tokenDescription` | string | Token description |
| `coingeckoCoinId` | string | CoinGecko coin ID |
| `useCoingeckoCoinId` | boolean | Enable CoinGecko integration |
| `circulatingSupplyUrl` | string | URL that returns circulating supply |
| `useCirculatingSupplyUrl` | boolean | Enable supply URL |
| `otherUrl` | string | Any other relevant URL |

Collect only the fields the user wants to update. Build the `tokenMetadata` object with just those fields plus `tokenId`. Do not include fields the user did not specify.

If they say **no**, or if `canMetadata: false`, skip metadata and continue.

## Step 4. Resolve Local Signer Source

Only for submission requests.

Check for a local signing source in this order:

1. `.env` / `.env.local` contains `PRIVATE_KEY` or `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`
2. `~/.config/solana/id.json`

Only confirm file paths and variable names in chat. Never print secret values. Only derive the wallet address inside the local execution script so it can verify that the signer matches `walletAddress`.

## Step 5. Batch-Collect Remaining Parameters

Collect all missing fields in one prompt, including confirmation that the paying wallet holds at least 1 JUP plus a small amount of SOL for fees.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `walletAddress` | Yes | Paying wallet; maps to `senderAddress` in the API body |
| `twitterHandle` | Yes for normal submission | Full `x.com` or `twitter.com` URL |
| `senderTwitterHandle` | No | Omit if not provided |
| `description` | Yes for normal submission | Short token description |

Validation rules:

- wallet must be a valid Solana public key
- Twitter URLs must be `https://x.com/...` or `https://twitter.com/...`
- bare handles may be normalized to `https://x.com/{handle}` with user confirmation
- omit absent optional fields instead of sending empty strings
- require the user to confirm the paying wallet currently holds at least 1 JUP plus a small amount of SOL for fees before continuing

## Step 6. Confirm Before Submitting

Summarize:

- token mint
- wallet address
- token Twitter URL
- requester Twitter URL if present
- description
- metadata fields to update, if any
- cost: 1 JUP

Require an explicit final confirmation that:

- the listed wallet will pay 1 JUP
- that wallet has enough SOL for network fees
- the user wants you to proceed with the submission now

## Step 7. Submit and Report

Load [Payment Execution](references/payment-execution.md) and follow the local signing flow:

1. craft the unsigned transaction with `GET /payments/express/craft-txn`
2. verify the transaction contents before signing
3. sign locally
4. submit via `POST /payments/express/execute`

Report the returned transaction signature and whether `verificationCreated` / `metadataCreated` were set.

# Input Auto-Correction

| User provides | Auto-correct to | Confirm? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@handle` or bare handle | `https://x.com/{handle}` | Yes |
| `twitter.com/handle` or `x.com/handle` | Add `https://` prefix | Yes |
| token mint with surrounding spaces | Trimmed string | No |
